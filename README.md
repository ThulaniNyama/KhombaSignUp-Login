# KhombaSignUp-Login

1. This is my first Reactjs app, with simple navigation, signup and login.
   The front end is in Reactjs and you would need to run "npm install"
   to run the app.
2. XAMPP, WAMP or MAMP is needed to run apache for mySQL database,
   place ALL the PHP files in htdocs of your server for REST API to connect
   to the database by either decoding or encoding json objects to and from the
   database.
